# TransE Knowledge Graph Implementation on Hetionet

This repository contains an implementation of the TransE algorithm, a method for knowledge graph embedding, applied to the Hetionet data set. Hetionet is a heterogeneous knowledge graph that encodes biology, integrating information from millions of scientific studies. The TransE algorithm translates embeddings for entities and relations in a knowledge graph, useful for tasks like link prediction and entity alignment.
